It performs several actions:\n\n1. Calculate the mean `requestedpay` of all the currently elected custodians.\n2. Distribute the median pay amount to all the currently elected custodians. This is achieved by adding a record to the `pendingpay` table with the custodian and the amount payable in preparation for a contract authorised action to transfer all the pending payments for custodians and recently unnominated candidates (from the `withdrawcand` action).\n3. Clears the existing vote counts for each voter and custodian in the current period in preparation for the tallying of votes for the next period.\n4. tally the votes based each voter's EOSDAC balance at the time `newperiod` is called. This is captured on the `weight` field for each vote. The same is also added to a chosen proxy if they have an active proxy vote.\n5. The vote `weight` for each vote is added to the `total_votes` field for each candidate resulting in the total votes being collated.\n6. The top `numelected` candidates based on the value of their `total_votes` has their `is_custodian` field set to true and the rest  are set to false.\n7. The `pendingreqpay` field value for each candidate is moved to the `requestedpay` field. This ensures the `pendingreqpay` field can be used for election campaiging for the next period while the `requestedpay` field can be used at the closing of the current period for pay calculations. \n "
